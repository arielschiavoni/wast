Using a simple interface we have achieved to cover very complex processes, to adjust them to You, without losing functions- such as automatic booking, linking documents,  etc.\r\n\r\nOur goal was to make a simple ERP software that covers complex processes.

A scoring system keeps track of your progress. After you conquer all levels in all difficulties, you will unlock the Dark Soldier who will haunt you through the more levels you play adding extra difficulty to your battle.\r\n\r\nTIPS:\r\n-Use the arrows and the A and Z buttons to control your hero.\r\n-For improving frame rate just press Ctrl+Shift+J two times (the first one to show the debug tools and again Ctrl+Shift+J to hide them).\r\n-Use the Down Arrow+ A or Z to activate the special hit which will devastate all enemies nearby. The special hit needs stamina which increases with every enemy killed (the blue bar). If the blue bar is full and you die you will be brought back to life from the same spot instead of at the level start.\r\n-Watch out and keep close eye on your blood level (the green bar). You have certain number of lives per chapter!\r\n-Your weapon gains more attack power if you constantly destroy your enemies. It feeds on destruction so keep it well fed and you will be alright (the yellow bar).\r\n-Watch out with the soldiers with spears, they are long! Time well your attacks and be patient.\r\n-BOSS BATTLES are quick time events: CLICK ON THE ICON before it vanishes and you will escape alive, if not, you will be squashed.\r\n\r\nNOTE: this is a large file, and downloading and installing takes some time.

      "longDesc": "Satisfy your curiosity\r\n\r\nTo stick out and get results in the information-saturated environment of today, you need to be ready to ask questions in a different way. The type of short, pertinent questions SurveyLegend is designed for help you to iteratively increase your knowledge rather than putting all your eggs in one basket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKnow Your Audience (and Yourself)\r\n\r\nBoth as a private citizen and when doing business, healthy communication is incredibly important. It's always important to develop and maintain the connections you have with your contacts. SurveyLegend helps you connect with the people that matter to you in a quick and cost-effective fashion. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Tool to Share It All\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to choosing a platform for sharing, one is usually not enough. Why settle for anything less than full coverage? SurveyLegend has built-in support for instant sharing to leading social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Linkedin. Letting your survey go social is simpler than... a really, really simple thing. Oh, by the way, you can also embed the survey in your blog or web page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Comedy Option\r\n\r\nTo paraphrase Stephen King: All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Why not use SurveyLegend to construct a maddening picture quiz for your friends and family, or have a contest for which lol cat picture is the most adorable?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFully Customize:\r\n\r\nSurveyLegend is a survey tool that gives you full customisation control; with the user-friendly design panel you can create the ultimate image based survey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy such customisation freedom?\r\n\r\nCompany using a survey case:\r\n\r\nBy being able to customise a survey to it's fullest, a company can brand and embed the survey directly to their web page.\r\n\r\nWhen a survey is presented directly on a web page, the participation in a survey will increase due to a visitor's loyalty to the company. Many companies conduct surveys on pre-existing customers but have a hard time getting the opinions of visitors passing through (potential customers) and engaging them to participate. By being able to integrate a survey into your first page, you can tap into visitors' opinions with a nicely executed questionnaire (survey).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can this survey (questionnaire) knowledge be used? \r\n\r\nA company uses the data gathered with the embedded survey to compare it to the survey data they have already gotten from their existing customers. By comparing survey data a company can see what existing customers like/don't like and compare it to the visitors responses on the questionnaire that was embedded.\r\n\r\nSurveys increase the company's chances to tap into new markets, optimise existing markets and attract new customers. So ask yourself; why haven't we started using SurveyLegend to cover our survey, questionnaire and poll needs?\r\n\r\nWith SurveyLegend, white label surveys have never been whiter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrimary Market Research:\r\n\r\nBy creating a survey with SurveyLegend, you can easily gain knowledge about your market's needs. With an image-based survey, your customers can express themselves when concerning to collection, brands and style. By conducting a survey you get to know how popular a style, design, brand or even article can become before you even have decided to deliver/offer it.\r\n\r\nPerforming primary market research has never been easier for companies than with SurveyLegend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondary Market Research:\r\n\r\nUsing SurveyLegend enables you to tap in to previously conducted surveys, for example if you have already done an employee satisfaction survey or customer satisfaction survey it's easy to go back and download the survey data for comparison or further analysis of the previously conducted surveys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuantitative Market Research:\r\n\r\nQuantitative market research focuses on standardised survey material that is spread vastly over the web or by paper. SurveyLegend makes it easy for the user to conduct quantitative market research through the web and the survey data gathered can be analysed inside the same survey tool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo paraphrase the book The Wisdom Of Crowds, \"One individual's answer is never better then a whole crowd's opinion (wisdom).\" Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSurvey Blogger Case:\r\n\r\nAs a blogger, the look and feel of one's blog posts is of utmost importance. It's truly the window to one's readers. A survey, questionnaire and poll that can be designed and embedded easily into one's post (blog) is a must-have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA blogger writes a post containing a survey, asking his/her readers what they think about a subject through the survey. The next post can be about the results of the survey.  As a blogger, a survey helps you engage your readers and gives you a new way of communicating. \r\n\r\nTo be able to do this you really have to use a survey tool that helps you create, design, and share in minutes. By using SurveyLegend for surveys, questionnaires, and polls you get all needed features in one great tool.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nReal-time results:\r\n\r\nSurvey Your Employees\r\n\r\nEmployee surveys are important for companies to perform, an employee survey gives an overall picture of the staff, their satisfaction, engagement, opinion and motivation.\r\n\r\nBut to get this knowledge you obviously have to crate surveys, questionnaires focusing on these topics. Topics like employee satisfaction, employee engagement, employee opinion and employee motivation.\r\n\r\nKnowing how your employees are doing and what they are missing is critical for a good work environment; by conducting survey regularly every year a company can easily look back and see if their actions have made any difference, for better or worse. \r\n\r\nIf employees are satisfied, the company will be even more successful.\r\n\r\nConducting an online questionnaire enables employees to participate privately from their own home. The questionnaire's data is automatically gathered together and can be analysed from day one using SurveyLegend. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSurvey your customers and see if they are satisfied\r\n\r\nCompanies do their best to cover their customers' needs, and a survey is a great way to communicate and get opinions from customers and customers to be.  Customer satisfaction surveys  give companies the advantage of knowing if their customers are satisfied with their services or not, and enables companies to respond accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat kind of surveys can you use?\r\n\r\n• Customer survey\r\n\r\n• Customer satisfaction survey questionnaire\r\n\r\n• Internal customer satisfaction survey\r\n\r\n• IT customer satisfaction survey\r\n\r\n• Product satisfaction survey\r\n\r\n• Product survey\r\n\r\n• Survey design\r\n\r\n• Picture survey\r\n\r\n• Image survey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat does SurveyLegend offer?\r\n\r\n• Customer satisfaction survey examples\r\n\r\n• Customer satisfaction survey templates\r\n\r\n• Customer satisfaction survey questions\r\n\r\n• Customer satisfaction survey template\r\n\r\n• Customer satisfaction survey form\r\n\r\n• Customer satisfaction survey report\r\n\r\n• Customer satisfaction survey results     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSurvey Age Ranges:\r\n\r\nWith SurveyLegend, you can customise the age range in your surveys. The data you get from surveys containing age ranges is rich. The creator of the questionnaire will be able to see the difference in the various age ranges and their opinions. Knowing what different customer segments think, need and like minimizes risks and increases your competiveness against competitors. Age will also reflect generational beliefs, values and roles. Asking for information about participants' age is completely optional.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGender Survey:\r\n\r\nKnowing if participants in a survey are male or female is essential when evaluating and comparing variations in feelings male or female customers have regarding your service. The gender question in a survey will have a relation to the cultural values, roles and beliefs of the gender within the society. This reflects the way questions are answered in a survey. Asking for gender information is completely optional.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIP Tracking Survey:\r\n\r\nBy knowing where the participant taking part in a survey questionnaire is geographically, the survey creator's abilities to recognise cultural differences in the answers is greatly enhanced. Location tracking in a survey shows the effects of cultural values, roles and beliefs of the country, continent or city specific to participant.\r\n\r\nA survey can easily be filtered down to the city level for further analysis. For example, are there differences in the answers to a certain question depending on if the participant is from Europe, Asia, Africa or America?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSurvey Question Examples:\r\n\r\nWhen creating a picture image survey questionnaire it's important to be able to ask more than age and gender questions before entering a picture image survey. Some of the surveys questions for a questionnaire survey are:\r\n\r\n• Work related survey question\r\n\r\n• Employment \r\n\r\n• Food \r\n\r\n• Education survey question\r\n\r\n• Health survey question\r\n\r\n• Demographics\r\n\r\nAbove are only some ideas for preliminary questions. You have full control over the questions you ask, and don't forget that the questions you ask a survey participant will help you to better understand the survey results and the participant/customer.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nShare:\r\n\r\nWith SurveyLegend you can easily share your survey to all your big social media portals like Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, LinkedIn or your blog.
